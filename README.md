Please use the provided CMakeLists.txt to compile the code. The program uses the optional module which requires the use of c++17. You can use CLion's built in CMake abilities or you can install and use cmake to make a configuration.

To become an official assignment, you should either provide a testing suite in common languages students like to use or make us make a testing suite ourselves. If you want to expand the scope, allow for multiple transactions between established entities. If you pick one language, you could provide the code for that. Or you could just make us implement classes for transactions and entities ourselves.
